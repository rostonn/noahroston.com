	<h2>Why I'm doing Galvanize</h2>
	<p>I got laid off from my Engineering job in August because the price of oil has been so low. I liked the money with chemical engineering but I wasn't passionate about the work.</p>

	<p>I have been interested in programming for a long time. I took this online programming course cs50x which is Harvard's introduction to Computer Science. The course is very well done and most of the programming is in C. But working takes a lot of time and I could not devote enough to programming to make the progress I was looking for.
	</p>
	<p>My friend Alex went to Galvanize and that is how I found out about the program. While I was working I thought if I get laid off then I will bet on myself and go to Galvanize. Now is the perfect time for me to go to Galvanize to become a Full-Stack developer</p>

	<h2>My Goals After Galvanize:</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>Be A Full-Stack Developer able to build AWESOME websites from scratch:</li>
			<ul>
				<li>Front End Design</li>
				<li>Back End Design</li>
			</ul>
		<li>Start My own Software company</li>
		<li>Or Work for a company with great people doing great things</li>
	</ul>
